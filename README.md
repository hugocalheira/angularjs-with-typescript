## Simple Register - C.R.D.
AngularJS 1.6 with TypeScript, Bootstrap v4, Sass, LocalStorage and Gulp.

`Create`, `Read` and `Delete`.
Sorry, `update` was not implemented, yet.

### Why AngularJS with TypeScript?
Just because!

## Installation
First...
```bash
sudo npm i --unsafe-perm node-sass
```
...then
```bash
sudo npm i
```

## Run
```bash
gulp watch
```
